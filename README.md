# Heavy patches on ESP8266

  * Patch in this sketch is: https://enzienaudio.com/h/FergusL/esp8266/
  * Based on https://github.com/bbx10/SFX-I2S-web-trigger/


As of 05-18-18 this is as far as I have *tried* to push the ESP8266. This patch has random, a few oscillators, noise and even a filter!  
Lots of improvements are still possible.

Good to see this super inexpensive chip can be used for this, as it doesn't even have a floating point unit!

The Heavy code running is exactly as returned by the cloud!
